# FrontEndCodeExercise
This is a simple client side only single page app I had to do as a code exercise for a job I had applied to in June 2016.  The css had to be vanilla (no frameworks) and the JavaScript had to be vanilla except for jQuery. I was also given a mockup I had to match as closely as possible, since it was a front end job that I had applied for. I'll include the mockup image in the resources directory for reference.
